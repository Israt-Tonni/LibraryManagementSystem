# LibraryManagementSystem
The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to manage the operations of a library. This system provides an easy-to-use interface that allows librarians to manage various aspects of the library such as book cataloging, lending and returning of books, tracking book availability, and generating reports.

XAMPP was used to set up the local server, PHPMyAdmin for the database management, and NetBeans as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

Features:

Book Cataloging: This feature allows librarians to add new books to the library database by providing details such as book title, author, publisher, ISBN number, and category.

Book Lending: This feature allows librarians to lend books to members and track the book's status. It also includes an option to extend the book's due date.

Book Return: This feature allows librarians to receive books back from members and update the book's status as available.

Book Availability: This feature allows librarians to check the availability of books in the library.

Reports: This feature allows librarians to generate reports such as books issued, books returned, and overdue books.

Member Management: This feature allows librarians to add, edit, and delete member details such as name, address, and contact information.

User Authentication: This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the library management system by requiring a username and password for login.

Future Enhancements:

Online Book Reservation: Allow members to reserve books online and track the status of their reservation.

Book Recommendation: Provide book recommendations to members based on their borrowing history.

Fine Calculation: Automatically calculate the fine for overdue books and generate reports.

Barcode Integration: Integrate barcode scanners to enable fast and efficient book lending and returning.

Conclusion:
The Library Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing library operations efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface, robust security features, and various functionalities to help librarians manage their library effectively. With future enhancements, this system can be further improved to meet the needs of modern libraries.
